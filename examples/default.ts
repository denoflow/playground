// Welcome to the Deno Playground!
// This site allows you to write, share and learn TypeScript
// on Deno backend without setting up an entire dev environment.

// You could think of it in two ways:
//  - A place to learn TypeScript in a place where nothing can break
//  - A place to experiment with TypeScript syntax & Deno backend and share the URLs with others

const helloWorld = `Hello from Deno v${Deno.version.deno}! ðŸ¦•`;
console.log(helloWorld);

// To learn more about the language, click above in "Examples".
// Otherwise, get started by removing these comments and explore the TypeScript & Deno world.
